# Day 01 Assessment

I plan to administer an assessment on Day 1 to gauge each student's understanding of computer science, programming, and data. My assessment form has two parts:

1. Student Evaluation on Computer Science and Data
2. Student Technical Knowledge and Skills

## Evaluation on Computer Science and Data

Students will write exactly three sentences for each question:

1. How do you understand "the field of computer science"?
2. How do you understand "programming"?
3. How do you understand "data and its importance"?
4. How do you think "AI will impact the world in the near future"?

These questions are designed to help students gain awareness of the subjects they will be learning. By restricting their responses to exactly three sentences, students will need to think carefully about their answers, which will also prevent them from simply copy-pasting paragraphs from the internet. I believe this approach will encourage brainstorming practice for those who may have little interest in the subject.

One last question:

- List 3 to 5 jobs or careers where understanding data is crucial.

This question aims to help students connect real-world scenarios with their classroom learning.

## Technical Knowledge and Skills

This section contains multiple-choice questions to assess student's technical knowledge and practical skills. Each section will have multiple choice questions.

### Section 1: Computer Science and Programming Knowledge

Code related MCQs. Test the student's understanding of conditionals and iterations.

### Section 2: Internet and Networking Knowledge

Understanding internet protocols.

### Section 3: Internet Research and Tools

To test student's ability to use the internet and tools for learning purpose.

### Section 4: Office Applications Skills

To test student's efficiency with Microsoft Office applications, especially spreadsheets.
