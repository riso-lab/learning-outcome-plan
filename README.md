# RISO Lab Learning Outcome Plan

## Challenges

1. Most students lack interest.
2. Course finished half-way with unsatisfactory progress.
3. Most students got unsatisfactory performance on assignments.

## Expectations

- To produce skilled programmers out of this class.
- Employer has clear vision of a skilled programmer:
    Understands data and can handle data manipulation.
    Understands business logic to produce better code quality.
- Accepts the way of "vocational class".

## Learning Outcome Plan

The following plan is to overcome the challenges and to achieve the expectations for this class.

1. Shift to project-based self-study approach
    - Not every class session needs to be filled with lecturers
    - Main focus on practical assignments
    - Read, write, discuss on subject matters to define clear goals on each assignment project
2. Simulate work environment
    - Pair students to encourage communication and team environment
    - Teacher acts as client, students build the solutions for the client
    - Assignment examples
        - Sort google drive folder names into a text file
        - Quiz app to use in classroom
        - Recipe app, weather app, todo app etc.
3. Understand the use of reusable code
    - Understand the efficiency of writing reusable code and using libraries

## Monitoring and feedback Plan

Student performance will be monitored and provide feedback according to the following KPI.

### KPI on Student projects

(++) to add points (--) to deduct points according to the action taken by the student.

1. Functionality of the program
    - ++ Main functions runs somoothly with the least bug.
    - ++ Try to catch errors.
    - ++ Write reusable code and use libries.
2. Creativity and Logical Thinking
    - ++ Add new features more than assignment instructions.
    - -- Bare minimum effort for the main functionality of the program.
    - ++ Break down the problem into smaller managable parts.
    - -- Hardcoded logic.
3. Communication
    - ++ Active participation. Actively discuss ideas with classmates.
    - ++ Document code, comment code.
