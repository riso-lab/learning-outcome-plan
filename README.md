# RISO Lab Learning Outcome Plan

## Challenges

1. Most students lack interest.
2. Course finished half-way with unsatisfactory progress.
3. Most students got unsatisfactory performance on assignments.

## Expectations

- To produce skilled programmers out of this class.
- Employer has clear vision of a skilled programmer:
    1. Understands data and can handle data manipulation.
    2. Understands business logic to produce better code quality.
- Accepts the way of "vocational class".

## Learning Outcome Plan

The following plan is to overcome the challenges and to achieve the expectations for this class.

1. Shift to project-based self-study approach
    - Not every class session needs to be filled with lecturers
    - Main focus on practical assignments
    - Read, write, discuss on subject matters to define clear goals on each assignment project
2. Simulate work environment
    - Pair students to encourage communication and team environment
    - Teacher acts as client, students build the solutions for the client
    - **Assignment examples (Beginner Level)**
        - Data Organization Tools: e.g. Sort google drive folder names into a text file.
        - Educational Tools: e.g. Quiz app to use in classroom.
        - Utility Apps: e.g. Recipe app, weather app, todo app etc.
    - **Capstone Project:** After completing a beginner code project, students will select a problem of interest to work on as their capstone project.
        - Students will be paired into teams.
        - Capstone project need to address significant, real-world issues for high-credit. Beginner level, low effort applications (e.g., calculator, drum set webpage) will cost the team's credit.
        - Development processes and solutions must be well-documented, including:
            - Problem statement
            - Design decisions
            - Code comments
            - User manuals or guides
        - A functional prototype should be completed and submitted at the end of the project.
3. To understand the whys for clean code, reusable code
    - To be able to write well documented clean code
    - To understand the efficiency of writing reusable code and using libraries and frameworks
    - To understand the importance of data and business logic in development

## Monitoring and feedback Plan

Student performance will be monitored and provide feedback according to the following KPI.

### KPI on capstone project

(++) to add points (--) to deduct points according to the action taken by the student.

1. Functionality of the program
    - ++ Main functions run smoothly with the least bug.
    - ++ Try to catch errors.
    - ++ Write reusable code and use libraries.
2. Creativity and Logical Thinking
    - ++ Add new features more than assignment instructions.
    - -- Bare minimum effort for the main functionality of the program.
    - ++ Break down the problem into smaller manageable parts.
    - -- Hard Coded logic.
3. Communication
    - ++ Active participation. Actively discuss ideas with classmates.
    - ++ Document code, comment code.

At the end of the project, teams should present their findings and prototype to the class, allowing for questions and feedback. Students will need to discuss and reflect on what they learned throughout the project, challenges they faced, and how they overcame them. I, as a tutor for this class, require **assistance from RISO Lab to organize workshops** on relevant technologies or methodologies (e.g., agile development, user experience design) to equip students with the necessary skills.
